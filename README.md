This project takes openly available data from **[Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)** to present a quick overview of how accommodation prices in Rome vary across the city, from street to street, from district to district. It is an example of basic data retrieval, cleaning and visualization, which can be useful either if you are a data science beginner or a tourist looking to spend some holiday time visiting the Colosseum.
